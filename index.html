										<h2>About Me</h2>
										<p>First Generation Armenian American College Graduate</p>
									</header>
									<p>I think who you are tomorrow starts with what you do today. Values
										taught in my family growing up with nothing much and sharing a room with my Grandma most of my life. 
										But with perseverance through laughs, hardships, losses, and blessings, I have learned to live by those values
										by heart.
									</p>
									<p>I think a lot of it came while learning how hard the grind is in life.
										I found myself getting a job working stockroom at a retail store at 3:00A.M. in the morning so I can have open availability
										to grab the classes I needed in college. I later found myself working 40 hours a week there while being a full time student to bring 
										to save up a little extra which ended up being more of a hindrance on myself than anything else. 
									</p>
									<p>I believe in a safe and friendly team environment. I have been in the situation in teams where I am either acted as the team leader, or the 
										person trying to pitch in and help in any way he can. Tasks should be assigned with the intention of being accomplished. Any unfinished tasks should
										be reviewed during team meeting and assignments should be adjusted accordingly, whether that means shifting ones position to fit them better or providing
										extra support in that area.

									<h3>Experience</h3>
									<p style="margin-left: 40px">
									</p>
									<p style="margin-left: 40px">Mathnasium has been great to me. We make math make sense. We teach in the ideology of a growth mindset,
                                        setting no upper boundaries to one's mind. That is an ideology I follow as a set myself to lead by example. Most of these skills 
                                        have all been self taught throughout the year, so when you hear the phrase "fast learner", here is what I have to actually back that up.
